# Maintaining the ASN numbers and prefixes 

To get the list of all Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) for a specific region, you'll need to query the relevant Regional Internet Registry (RIR). For Africa, the RIR is AFRINIC.

AFRINIC provides the delegated data which includes information about allocation and assignment of IPv4, IPv6 and ASN records in a machine-readable format.

Here's how you can obtain the list of all ASNs for Africa:

1. Download the latest delegated data file from the AFRINIC FTP server:

```bash
wget ftp://ftp.afrinic.net/pub/stats/afrinic/delegated-afrinic-latest
```

2. Extract all ASNs:

```bash
awk -F'|' '$2 == "AFRINIC" && $3 == "asn" {print $4}' delegated-afrinic-latest > afrinic_asns.txt
```

The file `afrinic_asns.txt` now contains all ASNs in Africa.

To do this in JavaScript, you would need to use a library like `node-fetch` to download the file, and then process the data using JavaScript's built-in string manipulation functions. Note that this would be more complex than doing it with a shell script, as shown above.
